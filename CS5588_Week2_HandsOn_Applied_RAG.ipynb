        "\n",
        "The Choice: Fixed Strategy (specifically Delimiter-Based) We chose a Fixed Chunking strategy based on newlines (one line = one record). Semantic chunking is dangerous for this product because the FDA files are structured databases saved as text, not narrative prose.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Why not Semantic? Semantic chunking tries to group \"related ideas.\" In this dataset, grouping \"related\" drugs (e.g., merging the Zepbound row with the Mounjaro row because they are similar) is a failure. Each row is a legally distinct entity; merging them creates a \"Frankenstein\" record that confuses the LLM.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Why Fixed/Delimiter? By forcing the chunker to respect the newline character \\n, we ensure that 1 Chunk = 1 Drug Listing. This preserves the \"atomic unit of truth.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Impact on Precision & Recall:\n",
        "\n",
        "  Precision (The \"Cut-Off\" Risk): Fixed chunking prevents \"Code Splitting.\" If we used a sliding window without respecting delimiters, an NDC like 0002-0152 might get cut in half (0002- in Chunk A, 0152 in Chunk B). The retriever would fail to find the exact code (Low Precision). Delimiter-based chunking guarantees the full ID stays intact.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Recall (The \"Needle in Haystack\"): By keeping chunks small (single rows), we prevent the \"Excluded\" status from getting diluted. If a chunk contained 50 drugs and only one was \"Excluded,\" the embedding might average out to \"General Drugs,\" causing us to miss the safety warning. Single-row chunking ensures the \"Excluded\" signal remains loud and retrievable.\n",
        "\n",
        "Impact on Trust: Trust in a regulatory tool is binary: One error destroys it. If the chunking strategy accidentally merges the \"Unfinished\" header from Line 1 with the \"Finished\" product on Line 2, the RAG system might tell a hospital to inject raw powder. Fixed, row-based chunking eliminates this structural hallucination risk, ensuring the evidence cited is exactly what the FDA published.\n"

Abstention as Counterfeit Protection (Crucial for U3 - Ambiguous) For the ambiguous/fake NDC case (U3), the greatest risk is a \"Plausible Lie.\" Generative models are trained to be helpful, so if a user asks about a fake code, a standard model often hallucinates a generic drug name (e.g., \"This is likely Ibuprofen\").\n",
